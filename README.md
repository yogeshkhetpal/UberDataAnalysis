# Analysis of Uber's Ridership Data for NYC.
## UberDataAnalysis

In early 2017, The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) released a dataset about Uber's ridership between September 2014 and August 2015. The data contains features distinct from those in the set previously released and throughly explored by FiveThirtyEight and the Kaggle community. 


This project was successfully completed using R programming language for data analysis and visualization. The aim of this project is to:

1. Visualize Uber's pickup trends in NYC during April 2014 till Sep 2014.
2. Characterize the demand within different time frames
3. other insights about the usage of the service


The analysis and visualization can be seen in a markdown file named 'uberAnalysis.md'.
